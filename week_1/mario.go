Week 1 - Assignment 2

Background
Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

Specification
- Write, in a file called mario.c in your ~/workspace/pset1 directory, a program that recreates these half-pyramids using hashes (#) for blocks.
- To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramids' heights, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. (The height of the half-pyramids pictured above happens to be 4, the width of each half-pyramid 4,
  with an a gap of size 2 separating them.)
- If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, you should re-prompt for the same again.
- Then, generate (with the help of printf and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramids.
- Take care to left-align the bottom-left corner of the left-hand half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.

		i, err := strconv.Atoi(text)
		switch {
		case err != nil:
			fmt.Print("Retry: ")
			continue
		case i <= 0 || i >= 23:
			fmt.Print("Height: ")
			continue
		}
		pyramids(i)
		break
	}
}

func pyramids(i int) {
	for n := 1; n <= i; n++ {
		block := strings.Repeat("#", n)
		spaces := strings.Repeat(" ", i-n)
		fmt.Printf("%s%s  %s\n", spaces, block, block)
	}
